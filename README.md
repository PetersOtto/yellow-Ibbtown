## My target
I developed the Ibbtown theme to have a basic theme for developing further themes. It is intended to be a starting point.
My target was not to keep the source code as small as possible. I wanted to create a theme that is as easy to understand as possible, can be easily modified, and contains programming solutions/examples for the most common problems.

The next projects will show, how helpful the theme really is. &#128512;

Of course, this theme can also be used by people who are not developers!

## Before installation
* Warning: I did not create the files for a wiki installation! This theme is unsuitable for a wiki installation!
* Please backup your page before installing this theme.

## How to install an extension
Download ZIP file and copy it into your `system/extensions` folder. [Learn more about extensions](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-update)

## After installation
### Opengraph
Currently, a placeholder image is being used as the Opengraph image. You should create your own Opengraph image and place it in the `\system\themes\ibbtown\images\` folder. The filename must be `opengraph.png`.

### Favicon
I use the [»realfavicongenerator«](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to create favicons. The favicons in the `/media/favicon/` folder should be replaced with your own favicons.

### Filter name »All Projects«
You can change the »All Projects« entry on your blog startpage if you want. Go to `\system\extensions\yellow-system.ini` and choose your filter name for all entries `TagnaviFilterName: Your Choose`.

### Footer
The footer entries can be changed in `footer.md`. This file is located in the folder `/content/shared/`

### Custom css code
Do you want to insert your own CSS code? Go to `/systeme/themes/` and enter your custom code in the »ibbtown.css« file.

## My target
I developed the Ibbtown theme to have a basic theme for developing further themes. It is intended to be a starting point.
My target was not to keep the source code as small as possible. I wanted to create a theme that is as easy to understand as possible, can be easily modified, and contains programming solutions/examples for the most common problems.

The next projects will show, how helpful the theme really is. &#128512;

Of course, this theme can also be used by people who are not developers!

## Before installation
* Warning: I did not create the files for a wiki installation! This theme is unsuitable for a wiki installation!
* Please backup your page before installing this theme.

## How to install an extension
Download ZIP file and copy it into your `system/extensions` folder. [Learn more about extensions](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-update)

## After installation
Currently, a placeholder image is being used as the Opengraph image. You should create your own Opengraph image and place it in the `\system\themes\ibbtown\images\` folder. The filename must be `opengraph.png`.
